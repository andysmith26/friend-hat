# Timebox Spikes To Three Hours

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

Friend Hat requires testing feasibility of uncertain technical choices. Experimentation can be endless without structure, as indicated by recent experience.

## Decision

Strictly timebox all spikes to 3 hours total across 3 phases:

- **30 min:** Define problem, success criteria, and approach
- **2 hours:** Execute experiment and collect evidence
- **30 min:** Document findings and make GO/NO-GO decision

Use a physical timer. Stop at time limit regardless of progress.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Forces clear problem definition before experimenting
- 3 hours can be completed in a single work session
- Documentation ensures the findings inform future decisions
- Hard stop on timer prevents perfectionism and scope creep
- Creates reusable artifacts for AI pairing and colleague discussion

### Costs

- Timer might interrupt productive exploration
- Structure adds stress in environments with frequent interruptions.
- Documentation reduces hands-on time to 66% of allocated timebox
